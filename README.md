# Twitter-WorldCup-Mute-Filters

## Purpose

For all those people, who are annoyed about all the football related Tweets in their timeline, here's a list containing mute filters for the world-cup in Brazil for the very well-known Twitter client Tweetbot.

## How to import to Tweetbot app on iOS 

1. Copy the whole content of the *.txt file to the clipboard of your iOS device
2. Send an email containing the whole device clipboard content to your personal inbox 
3. Open the previously sent email with the Mail.app on the iOS device (default mail client on iOS)
4. Click on each link (`tweetbot:///[...]`) and add the mute filters to Tweetbot. Repeat this step for every link in the mail.
5. Uff, finally done!

Unfortunately this is the only solution which seems to work. Otherwise the Tweetbot links - which should automatically open the "Add new mute filter" part within Tweetbot - won't be recognized. 

Sorry about that - but I think it's still much better than having tons of World Cup related Tweets in your timeline.

## How to import to Tweetdeck

Developers are lazy, so this small script helps you, adding all those keywords to Tweetdeck.
You just have to open the mute-window, press Ctrl-Shift-J, paste the code from tweetdeckAuto.min.js and press Enter.
You may get some errors in Firefox, that a script is not responding, do not cancel the execution of the script, just give it some time.

Works fine for me in Chromium and Firefox.
