# Tweetbot-WorldCup-Mute-Filters

## Purpose

For all those people, who are annoyed about all the football related Tweets in their timeline, here's a list containing mute filters for the world-cup in Brazil for the very well-known Twitter client Tweetbot.

## Import to Tweetbot app on iOS 

1. Copy the whole content of the *.txt file to the clipboard of your iOS device
2. Send an email containing the whole clipboard content to your personal inbox 
3. Open the email with the Mail.app on iOS (default mail client on iOS)
4. Click on each link and add the mute filter to Tweetbot
5. Done!

Unfortunately this is the only solution which seems to work. Otherwise the Tweetbot links - which should automatically open the "Add new mute filter" part within Tweetbot - won't be recognized. 

Sorry about that - but I think it's still much better than having tons of World Cup related Tweets in your timeline.
